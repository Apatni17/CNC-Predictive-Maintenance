## Introduction

Predictive maintenance involves using data analysis tools and techniques to detect anomalies in your operations and possible defects in equipment and processes so you can fix them before they result in failure. This project focuses on predictive maintenance for CNC machines, leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict failures based on historical data.
