## Configuration

The configuration settings for running the scripts are defined as follows:

| Configuration             | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Model**                 | The machine learning model to be used for prediction.                                                                                                              |
| **Sampler**               | Sampling method to balance the dataset.                                                                                                                            |
| **Sampling Strategy**     | Desired number of samples for each class after resampling. You can specify the exact number of samples for non-anomalous and anomalous classes.            |
| **Future Steps**          | Number of future steps to predict. For example, if set to 3, the model will predict steps $K$, $K+1$, and $K+2$.                                                   |
| **Window Size**           | Size of the sliding window for feature extraction. For example, a window size of 3 means using the past 3 time steps $K-3$, $K-2$, $K-1$ to predict the next step. |
| **Test Size**             | Number of samples to include in the test split. This determines the amount of data reserved for testing the model.                                                 |
| **Seed**                  | Random seed for reproducibility. Setting this ensures that the results are consistent across different runs.                                                       |
| **Correlation Threshold** | Correlation threshold for feature selection. Features with correlation higher than this threshold will be removed to avoid multicollinearity.                      |
